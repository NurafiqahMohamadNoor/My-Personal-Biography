<p> <center> I prefer to work with a group because this type of work establishes a better relationship between the team members. As humans, socialization is important for us and working with a team gives us a chance to improve our relationship. When people are in a team, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. For example, when i appointed as exco for dicipline and security in Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej Kompleks Tok Gajah (2018/2019), I made new friends because we were involved in a team organization together. From that, we did build a good relationship among each other, and we are still in touch. </center>
